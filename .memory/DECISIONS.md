- Decision: Governance-only memory (no MCP server) using CLAUDE.md + .memory files.
- Rationale: Minimum complexity while maintaining continuity across sessions.
- Alternatives considered: Full MCP project-memory server with ChromaDB.
- Consequences / Follow-ups: If memory friction grows, revisit adding MCP later.
